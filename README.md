## Hey, I'm Bharath 
  — a data science grad student passionate about exploring how **data shapes the automotive world.**

### 🚗 What I’m Building at the moment:
**BN Garage** — my personal space to experiment, analyze, and visualize automotive data.
Each project explores a new aspect of auto intelligence:
- 🧩 **SQL Dealership Systems** → inventory, pricing & sales analytics
- ⚙️ **NLP for Recalls** → understanding manufacturer issues & consumer reports
- 📈 **Predictive Models** → reliability, resale value, and maintenance forecasts
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Experiments** → clustering, embeddings, and anomaly detection on car data

### 🧰 Tech Stack
`Python` • `SQL` • `Pandas` • `scikit-learn` • `NLTK` • `Plotly` • `Power BI`  

### 💡 Vision
To blend automotive passion with data-driven storytelling — building insights that help make cars smarter, safer, and more reliable.

📍 Currently at University of Arizona  
💼 Open to collaborations on automotive data science projects
